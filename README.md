Introduction:
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on certain features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc. This is a binary classification problem, where the output can be either 0 or 1, indicating the absence or presence of diabetes, respectively. The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database. The dataset consists of the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating the presence or absence of diabetes
Requirements:

Python 3.6 or higher
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
Installation:

Install the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install the required Python packages using pip. Open the command prompt or terminal and enter the following command:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyterlab
Usage:

Download the dataset from the above mentioned URL and store it in a folder.
Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the folder where the dataset is stored.
Open the diabetes_prediction.ipynb file and run the code cells to train the model and make predictions.
The trained model can be used to predict diabetes for new patients by providing their feature values as input.
